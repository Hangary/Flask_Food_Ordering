You are required to maintain a log book through the entire project that records:

- date of regular, stand-up meetings
- summary of decisions made in stand-up meetings, requirements elicited and key design decisions (hand-written user-stories, CRC cards etc.)
- responsibilities allocated to each team member and tasks to be accomplished for the next meeting
- progress of tasks using a velocity chart (a hand-drawing will suffice, no sophisticated tool needed), summary of decisions made in stand-up meetings
- milestones achieved
- reflection if assigned tasks (decided from last meeting) have been achieved
- any obstacles

## 27/3 Week 06 Regular Meeting

*Location: Lab | Participants: Kanadech, Gary, Gaurang | Duration: 2 hrs*

**Decisions**:

- Finish the basic skeleton for the codes
- Finish the first version of the Class Diagram
- Begin implementing more features based on the draft codes

-------

## 30/3 Week 06 Online Discussion

*Location: Online, Messenger | Participants: Kanadech, Gary, Gaurang | Duration: 1 hrs*

**Milestones**: Finish the basic skeleton of the project codes

**Decisions**:

- Finish the basic skeleton for the codes
- Finish the first version of the Class Diagram
- Begin implementing more features based on the draft codes

**Work Assigned**:

- *Kanadech*: Use `Pickle` to store class information; Create the system creator to read data from an external file and initialize the online order system
- *Gary*: Finish the user story part 1 and some basic tests
- *Gaurang*: Implement the staff system and login function

## 1/4 Week 07 Review Meeting

*Location: Columbo Theatre | Participants: Kanadech, Gary*

**Milestones:** Finish the `system_creator` and user stories for ordering drinks and sides.

**Content**:

- Found out some problems in our codes
- Decided to refactor our codes to make it more orderly

**Obstacle**: For the same user stories, we use different implementations. So we have to reach a consensus about how should we use our classes.

**Tasks to do**:

1. Refactor our codes and fix some logical bugs
2. Add more features like `exception handling` into our codes

**Content**:

- Clarified the customer workflow of our codes

- Decided to integrate our unit tests and transform the integration test into more specific user-stories tests via `pytest`

**Work Asignned**:
