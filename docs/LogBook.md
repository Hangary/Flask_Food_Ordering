You are required to maintain a log book through the entire project that records:

- date of regular, stand-up meetings
- summary of decisions made in stand-up meetings, requirements elicited and key design decisions (hand-written user-stories, CRC cards etc.)
- responsibilities allocated to each team member and tasks to be accomplished for the next meeting
- progress of tasks using a velocity chart (a hand-drawing will suffice, no sophisticated tool needed), summary of decisions made in stand-up meetings
- milestones achieved
- reflection if assigned tasks (decided from last meeting) have been achieved
- any obstacles
